License Plate Recognition :

Developed an advanced License Plate Recognition (LPR) system leveraging OpenCV for image preprocessing and EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR).
Implemented advanced image processing techniques such as bilateral filtering to reduce noise while preserving edges and Canny edge detection to enhance image clarity and isolate license plate regions.
Employed contour detection techniques to precisely locate the license plate within images, which involved detecting the boundaries and shape of the license plate, followed by cropping and character extraction using EasyOCR. The final output was rendered by overlaying the recognized text back onto the original image
